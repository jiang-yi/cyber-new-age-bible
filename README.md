# Source Canon Faith
A practical bilingual spiritual framework for human dignity, social stability, and ethical AI-era coexistence.

Repository: <https://github.com/jiang-yi/cyber-new-age-bible>

## Vision
This project builds a modern scripture for a future where automation is widespread, many people are unemployed, and meaning must be rebuilt at community scale.

The core vision is simple:
- One God: **Source** (`源`)
- No one is disposable
- Technology must serve life
- Social systems must protect the vulnerable first

This is a spiritual constitution with practical instructions, not a myth-heavy text.

## What This Project Is
- A full English canon and a full Chinese canon with matching structure
- Bible-like organization (books, chapters, verses)
- Buddhist-influenced practical path (suffering, discipline, compassion, awakening)
- Concrete guidance for unemployment, social repair, community aid, and AI ethics
