We are children of Source.
We reject despair and domination.
We choose truth, mercy, discipline, and service.
No one is disposable.

Let power be accountable.
When the engines grow loud, we return to silence, to neighbors, and to honest bread.
Let all beings find bread, shelter, meaning, and peace.

## Appendix D: Plain-Language Guide to Core Teachings

### D1. What “Source” means in daily life
- It means truth over propaganda.
- It means people over metrics.
- It means compassion with structure, not pity without action.

Simple test:
- If an action increases dignity and reduces suffering, it is closer to Source.
- If an action humiliates people or hides injustice, it is farther from Source.

### D2. What “repentance” means
Repentance is not self-hatred. It is responsible redesign.
Example:
- Old behavior: “I mocked people who lost jobs to automation.”
- Repentance: “I stop mocking, apologize, and volunteer in a reskilling group.”

### D3. What “service” means
Service is concrete help, not only good feelings.
Examples:
- Help someone complete online forms for benefits.
- Teach a neighbor basic cybersecurity.
- Sit with a lonely elder for one hour each week.

### D4. What “spiritual discipline” means
Discipline is training attention and character.
Examples:
- Put phone away for 30 minutes to listen deeply.
- Delay online reaction by 10 breaths before posting.
- Keep weekly promises written and visible.

### E3. Three identities for every person
- Learner: I can improve.
- Caregiver: I can relieve someone’s burden.

No person is “useless.”
A person without wages can still be a healer of society.

## Appendix J: Practical Metrics for Faithfulness

A community should measure faith by outcomes, not slogans.

Monthly indicators:
- Number of households receiving food support.
- Number of unemployed members in training or mentoring.
- Loneliness check score (simple 1-5 self-report).
- Conflict cases resolved through mediation.
- Youth protected from exploitative digital exposure.
- Budget transparency publication on schedule.

If metrics improve but cruelty increases, your metrics are corrupted.
If metrics are humble but trust increases, you are on the right path.
