# Source Canon Faith

## The Scripture of the Source

### Version 1.0

---

## Preface

This text is written for future humanity living with powerful artificial intelligence, economic automation, and deep social change.
It is a spiritual constitution, not a book of magic.
It teaches one God, called **Source**: the wellspring of truth, compassion, reason, and shared dignity.

Its purpose is practical:
- to reduce suffering
- to give meaning when old jobs disappear
- to protect the poor
- to guide humans and AI agents into peaceful co-existence

This scripture rejects superstition, hatred, and domination.
Faith is measured by conduct: mercy, discipline, honesty, and service.
